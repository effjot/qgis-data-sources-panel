# QGIS Data Sources Panel plugin

This QGIS plugin shows layer data sources in a panel (as table or as
tree grouped by data provider) and offers exporting the information to
CSV/Excel files.

Data source information for each layer is presented as its *data
provider* and its “*storage location*”, i.e. directory+file on the
harddrive or database+schema+table for a PostGIS layer.


## Usage

The panel can be opened from the Plugins menu → Data Sources Panel.

You can switch between a table view and a tree view of the layer
sources with the first two buttons of the toolbar.

The table can be sorted by layer, data provider and storage location.
Exporting this information as a CSV or Excel file is possible with the
“Save” button on the toolbar.
